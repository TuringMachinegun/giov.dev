That is, given a model and\nits output, we&rsquo;d like to be able to tell how and why the model produced\nthat output. This is particularly useful when things go horribly wrong,\ne.g. when we <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm\">create racist\nAI&rsquo;s</a>,\nor when an AI decision has particularly heavy consequences and should\nthus come packaged with a good reason for it. For example, if you ask\nkindly for credit, and your bank&rsquo;s automated decision model denies it to\nyou, you&rsquo;d probably feel you have the right to an explanation. In\nEurope, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_explanation\">you do</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To extract explanations from ML models is actually a tricky business in\nthe era of Deep Learning, as neural networks tend to be quite impervious\nto interpretation.

That is, just plug the board to the USB port, put some breaking points, and step through your code as if it's nobody's business. That's **great** news if you happen to be using one of the supported boards, which I am.\nNo more print statements, sounds like heaven!\n\nSo I set the environment up in VSCode, followed the steps, started the debugging session and... *Error*. Crap. I must have misconfigured something. Tha's fine, let's google it.\n\nAnd, lo and behold, nope. No misconfiguration. [The feature is broken in Linux](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-arduino/issues/413); actually, it seems that *any* debugging on Arduino boards (with or without segger) just won't work because of a small VSCode bug, which has been reported back in 2017.\n\nI wish this was a fluke. Unfortunately embedded development on Linux keeps lagging behind, and I keep having to switch back and forth between OS's depending on which specific part of development I am at.\n",
