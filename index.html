<p>Shining the right kind of light, we can re-activate the specific population of neurons activated by a given task, leading to the mouse experiencing a memory of the task itself.</p>

<em>This post is the transcript of an informational video I created. You can find the video at the bottom of the post.</em></p>

<p>In the last few years we are seeing an explosion of devices to track our health and fitness.</p>

<p>Two important reasons for the explosion are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sensors are becoming cheaper and cheaper, and</p></li>

<li><p>Nearly everyone now walks around with an internet gateway in their pocket</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These two facts together mean that <strong>companies can cheaply create devices that record data from sensors on the body</strong> and ship that data to their servers.</p>

<p>There, algorithms can learn from new data, and process it to return useful statistics to the user, like calories burned, blood pressure, or even cortisol levels.
This is currently the leading paradigm in fitness and health wearable technology.</p>

<p>Now, if the last decade of internet has taught us something, is that <strong>entrusting sensitive personal data to the cloud is a guaranteed recipe for disaster</strong>.
To give one eminent wearable-related example: in February 2018, <strong>hackers stole data from 150 million users of the popular fitness app &ldquo;MyFitnessPal&rdquo;</strong>. This app tracks diet and exercise, and it can be connected to many wearable fitness devices, collecting the data they generate.</p>

<p>If your instinctive reaction to third parties having access to your health metrics is &ldquo;so what?&rdquo;, you&rsquo;re probably not exercising your imagination enough. Data gets breached all the time for all kind of service providers. Combine the breaches together, and things get uncomfortable very fast.</p>

<p>What happens when a third party can combine, for example, your DNA data with your diet and fitness metrics, credit data, and political affiliation? (This is not speculation, huge leaks of all these types of data have appeared in the news in the last few years). What happens is that <strong>they can start predicting things about you, that you yourself are unaware of</strong>. Obviously not a desirable state of things, especially considering the kind of players that would buy data from illegal hacks.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-the-alternative">What&rsquo;s the alternative?</h2>

<p>We must migrate to service architectures where sensitive data is not centralized, but rather kept  with the user. This challenge can be tackled by <strong>combining <em>Edge computing</em> and <em>Privacy-preserving Machine Learning</em>.</strong></p>

<p>With <em>Edge computing</em>, we process data locally rather than on the cloud. In this way, user privacy is protected, and <strong>there&rsquo;s no central repository of sensitive data</strong> there to tempt hackers and shady players.</p>

<p>To keep improving the quality of the service, we can use recent developments in <em>Privacy-preserving Machine Learning</em> algorithms to learn from a great number of users, while they only <strong>provide data which can&rsquo;t be used to reconstruct sensitive information.</strong></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll dive in more details on Privacy-preserving Machine Learning in a future episode of this series.</p>

<em>This post is the transcript of an informational video I created. You can find the video at the bottom of the post.</em></p>

<p>With the maturing of IoT technology, we can cover the world in sensors, and give computers access to the physical world in a way that just wasn&rsquo;t possible before.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example. You have a factory, with lots of machines designed to assemble a widget. From time to time, one of these machines breaks, disrupting production and leaving you with a big headache. Having heard of &ldquo;predictive maintenance&rdquo;, you decide to place sensors all over the production line. <strong>These sensor collect data continuously.</strong></p>

<p>The data collected by the sensors is very often not easily understood by humans. We just don&rsquo;t deal very well with high-dimensional mathematics.
Luckily, we have computers, and <strong>we have figured out many techniques to teach them to recognize patterns in high-dimensional, complex data. This set of techniques go under the name of &ldquo;Machine Learning&rdquo;</strong>.</p>

<p>With Machine Learning, experts can create automated systems that can alert you when something in the production line is not behaving as it should, allowing you to schedule timely repairs, saving money and preventing headaches.</p>

<p>But this is not the end of the story.</p>

<p>In a typical setup, the automated system lives on a server, and receives a continuous stream of raw data directly from the sensors on the production line.
This comes at a very high cost, because of the sheer amount of data being continuously produced, moved, crunched and stored.
A solution to this problem is to <strong>move intelligence from the central server towards the sensors, a paradigm known as &ldquo;Edge computing&rdquo;.</strong></p>

<p>Instead of continuously sending raw data to a central powerful computer, we can put many small computers where the sensors live, and teach them to, in a way, &ldquo;reduce the chatter&rdquo;.
That is, we can again use Machine Learning to make these small computers only send high-level, condensed information, and only when it matters.</p>

<p><strong>The number of sensors in the world is about to grow from the order of billions to that of trillions.</strong> It is increasing much faster than our ability to deal with the data they generate.
To fully harness the power of the huge sensor network we are building for our physical world, <strong>we must distribute intelligence in the network itself, make sensors smarter and able to decide what to communicate, when, and where to send the information.</strong></p>

<p>The challenge facing explainable AI is in creating explanations that
are both complete and interpretable: it is difficult to achieve
interpretability and completeness simultaneously. The most accurate
explanations are not easily interpretable to people; and conversely
the most interpretable descriptions often do not provide predictive
power.</p>

<p>â€” from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00069.pdf">Explaining Explanations: An Overview of Interpretability of
Machine Learning</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unpacking some important terms from the quote,</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Interpretable explanation</strong>:  an explanation that is understandable by humans,</li>
<li><strong>Complete explanation</strong>:  an explanation describing the underlying reality accurately.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="transparent-machines">Transparent machines</h2>

<p>We would like ML models to be &lsquo;transparent&rsquo;. That is, given a model and
its output, we&rsquo;d like to be able to tell how and why the model produced
that output. This is particularly useful when things go horribly wrong,
e.g. when we <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm">create racist
AI&rsquo;s</a>,
or when an AI decision has particularly heavy consequences and should
thus come packaged with a good reason for it. For example, if you ask
kindly for credit, and your bank&rsquo;s automated decision model denies it to
you, you&rsquo;d probably feel you have the right to an explanation. In
Europe, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_explanation">you do</a>.</p>

<p>To extract explanations from ML models is actually a tricky business in
the era of Deep Learning, as neural networks tend to be quite impervious
to interpretation. It&rsquo;s a hard task to go looking at the mess of
connections and weights and find much &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; at all.</p>

<p>While researchers are making some progress on explaining the decisions
of current models, it is easy to see that as ML systems get more
complex, it gets harder and harder to maintain interpretability without
losing completeness. In fact, due to the limitations of our cognition,
interpretability is much easier to lose than it is to gain completeness,
and given that below a certain point of interpretability an explanation
is fundamentally useless, completeness just has to give.</p>

<p>In other words, past a certain complexity, if you want an intelligible
explanation of what the ML model is doing, you&rsquo;ll have to settle for the
fact that the explanation might not reflect exactly what&rsquo;s going on
under the hood.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.giov.dev/uploads/2019/ebe54af01b.jpg" width="600" height="446" alt="Reality, a shapeless squiggly doodle, vs explanation, a clean rectangle." />
<em>Reality vs explanation, rendered with questionable drawing skills</em></p>

<h2 id="transparent-humans">Transparent humans</h2>

<p>We have known for a while that very little of the workings of our own
minds is accessible to us, together with even less of the workings of
the external world. Yet, we still ask ourselves and other people the
<em>why</em> of our behavior.</p>

<p>With this premise, to ask yourself <em>why</em> you did something, is to invite
the part of your mind in charge of weaving narratives to make something
up that respects a list of constraints, such as your model of yourself
and the world, the way you think others see you, the way you think
others <em>should</em> see you, and so on. Completeness doesn&rsquo;t really figure
in these requirements.</p>

<p>The fact is that, as humans, we just love interpretability much more
than we do completeness. Explanations are there to drive behavior, so we
tend to value neat, actionable narratives much more than we do complete
accounts.</p>

<p>This sets weird incentives when considering our desire to have
transparent Machine Learning models. If completeness is hard to maintain
past a certain complexity, and we didn&rsquo;t care that much for it in the
first place, we are bound to drive ML systems towards interpretability
instead. For complex enough systems, the completeness of the explanation
might be so out of the question, that interpretability is all that&rsquo;s
left, leaving us to drive explanations towards the interpretations that
we like the most, no matter how far they stray from the underlying
reality.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually exactly what happens with humans and with the
explanations we come up with for our own and other people&rsquo;s behavior. It
is only when we get marginally more exposure to our inner workings
(through e.g. psychedelics or meditation), that we can directly perceive
the incongruence between the explanations we create and what&rsquo;s
<em>actually</em> going on &ndash; leaving us baffled and in need for new
explanations.</p>

         	<p>So, IoT is (finally) definitely coming. What we are looking at, is an ever-increasing  number of sensors in the environment, from which huge amounts of data will be generated.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that to deal with that, intelligence must be moved &ldquo;down&rdquo;, as close to the sensors as possible. In this way, we don&rsquo;t actually need to move that much data around &ndash; the sensors can extract the relevant information locally, and transmit the juicy parts of what&rsquo;s happening to some central system. This is the core idea behind Edge computing.</p>

<p>Now, if we want to cover the world in sensors, they must be as cheap as possible while still being able to do their job. Which means that whatever intelligence they  need, it better be streamlined to the limit, as computation has a cost. This limitation doesn&rsquo;t really apply to the central system, or not as heavily.</p>

<p>Both sensors and central system will be dealing with highly complex multi-dimensional data; this points to Machine Learning playing the lead role in enabling them to do their job (for any non-trivial job).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning">You can attack Machine Learning models</a>, trying to fool them with carefully prepared data. There seems to be <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxAb30cY7">some indication</a> that trying to make a model robust to attacks actually decreases its prediction performance. This might mean that, rather than making models robust, one would have a separate system checking that input data doesn&rsquo;t look &ldquo;attack-y&rdquo;, whatever that means in practice.</p>

<p>All of these pieces and possibilities paint an extremely interesting panorama for cyber warfare, or general malicious attacks towards future (present?) IoT systems.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sensors on the Edge are probably going to be very vulnerable to adversarial attacks. There&rsquo;s very little resources to spare to &ldquo;sanity check&rdquo; malicious input, and it&rsquo;s easy to imagine the robustness / performance ratio of the models being more susceptible for skewing in the performance direction. On the other hand, in the &ldquo;massive sensor deployment&rdquo; scenario, attacking enough sensors at once to have an effect on the overall system might be tricky. Also&hellip; how do you provide malicious data to an accelerometer?</p></li>

<li><p>The central systems are (hopefully) going to be more robust to adversarial attacks, simply because resources are going to be less of a problem. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s much simpler to fake input data here, if one is able to run some kind of man-in-the-middle scheme.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>As for the title: these thoughts have been inspired by yours truly getting up from a chair and getting the million-crawling-ants feeling from my foot. I thank my brain for being robust to such adversarial attacks.</em></p>

<p>Email scammers can send hundred of thousands of emails with very little effort, but once somebody replies, they&rsquo;ll have to spend time in the email back-and-forth to bring the scam to completion. As <a href="https://youtu.be/_QdPW8JrYzQ">James Veitch</a> explained, that&rsquo;s a good point of attack. If you tie the scammer up in a back-and-forth with you, they are not scamming somebody else.

<li><p>Write a conversational AI simulating the responses of somebody baiting on the scam</p></li>

<li><p>Make it part of a scam filter app running on email servers</p></li>

<li><p>Disseminate</p></li>

<p><em>Image taken from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/1hy7fu/never_look_down_the_barrel_xpost_from_rfunny/">this post</a> on reddit.</em></p>

<p>These are thoughts in response to an <a href="https://blog.dataiku.com/do-more-machine-learning-ai-without-more-data-scientists">article</a> on dataiku about empowering more people in an organization to use ML.</p>

<p>Often there&rsquo;s just not enough data scientists to support the needs of an entire organization. The typical recommendations - and trend - to alleviate this problem is to put effort in setting up self-service analytics, and automatic model creation with AutoML.</p>

<p>While I do think self-service analytics have a big role to play, I am not at all convinced about AutoML. What&rsquo;s that?</p>

<p>To quote from <a href="https://www.automl.org/">my third Google result</a> for &ldquo;AutoML&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AutoML provides methods and processes to make Machine Learning available for non-Machine Learning experts, to improve efficiency of Machine Learning and to accelerate research on Machine Learning. Machine learning (ML) has achieved considerable successes in recent years and an ever-growing number of disciplines rely on it. However, this success crucially relies on human machine learning experts to perform manual tasks. As the complexity of these tasks is often beyond non-ML-experts, the rapid growth of machine learning applications has created a demand for off-the-shelf machine learning methods that can be used easily and without expert knowledge. We call the resulting research area that targets progressive automation of machine learning AutoML.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, people with no data science expertise should be able to roll out their own automatically generated Machine Learning model, to support decisions in what the dataiku article would categorize as &ldquo;simpler projects&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="why-automl-is-not-the-solution">Why AutoML is not the solution</h2>

<p>I am extremely skeptical of using AutoML when you don&rsquo;t have expertise in Machine Learning. With the right data, and the right problem? Sure, you might get a decent model out. The issue is that you <em>need</em> training to be able to tell what the right data is, what a decent model is, and even how to define the problem correctly in the first place!</p>

<p>Otherwise you better expect garbage.</p>

<p>It is so very easy to fool yourself into a data-backed story that crumbles down as soon as you start poking it, and you need <em>a lot</em> of training to avoid fooling yourself (as an aside, this seems to be a general rule for life). With this in mind, when you are not trained to reason on data or ML, AutoML is just a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether the idea is to only apply it to &ldquo;simpler projects&rdquo;. Decision based on garbage are still based on garbage, independent from project complexity.</p>

<h2 id="train-your-people-make-them-effective">Train your people, make them effective</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, empowering more people to play with data in an organization is a <em>brilliant</em> idea. But you have to train your people first!</p>

<p>You can take away the software engineering pains of data science, and even a lot of Machine Learning boilerplate processes; In that, tools are extremely useful. But you can&rsquo;t take away the data science. You need people to be able to reason about problems, data and  models. No amount of AutoML is going to help if you don&rsquo;t have that.</p>

<p>If you have to invest in something to make your organization data-driven, invest in your people. Invest in training. Don&rsquo;t try to substitute tools for expertise.</p>

<p>Arduino debugging can be a pain, as you need to get a (quite expensive) specialized piece of hardware, that you then need to hook in the right way to the board in order to get going.</p>

<p>Now, Microsoft has introduced <a href="ttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/iotdev/debug-your-arduino-code-with-visual-studio-code/">a very nifty feature</a> in the Arduino extension for VSCode, which allows you to debug some Arduino boards without any additional hardware. That is, just plug the board to the USB port, put some breaking points, and step through your code as if it&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s business. That&rsquo;s <strong>great</strong> news if you happen to be using one of the supported boards, which I am.
No more print statements, sounds like heaven!</p>

<p>So I set the environment up in VSCode, followed the steps, started the debugging session and&hellip; <em>Error</em>. Crap. I must have misconfigured something. Tha&rsquo;s fine, let&rsquo;s google it.</p>

<p>And, lo and behold, nope. No misconfiguration. <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-arduino/issues/413">The feature is broken in Linux</a>; actually, it seems that <em>any</em> debugging on Arduino boards (with or without segger) just won&rsquo;t work because of a small VSCode bug, which has been reported back in 2017.</p>

<p>I wish this was a fluke. Unfortunately embedded development on Linux keeps lagging behind, and I keep having to switch back and forth between OS&rsquo;s depending on which specific part of development I am at.</p>
